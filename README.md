### Overview

In this project CSS frameworks were used to create a codespace footer.

### Reflections

I was introduced to Tailwind, which was easy to use. I understand it the shortcode for CSS. I even added hover styles to improve accessibility

#### Challenges Faced

Intalling node.js was a bit challenging for me, because of the network, which delayed my time to finish the project. But it was an easy follow to see what was done and how to code the footer. 
#### Areas for Improvement

Practice CSS to improve my understanding.

#### Overall Learning Experience

The introduction of CSS frameworks is usefull as it teaches us ways to shorten the time it takes for us to complete projects. Very interesting. Looking forward to practicing.
